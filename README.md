# TicTacToe

This is a code for a AI that plays the Tic Tac Toe game. Here is the Wikipedia webpage about the Tic Tac Toe game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

If you run the code, the terminal will display a grid and a line like this:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
player 1 please enter the number of an empty cell:

The human player begins first, so the user needs to enter an integer between 1 to 9 (inclusive).
Lets enter position 5 as an example. The following output from the program will  be:

player 1 please enter the number of an empty cell: 5
1 2 3
4 X 6
7 8 9
the computer chooses number 1
O 2 3
4 X 6
7 8 9

The symbol X represents the position chosen by the user, and the symbol O represents the position chosen by the AI.

Keep playing the game until it ends, the game has two results: either one of the players wins or draws. 
The AI is able to win or draw in most situations.
